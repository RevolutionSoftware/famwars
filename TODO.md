# TODO

* a way to select an option
* we also need to check what tile we're on
* first check if there's a unit on that tile
* if it hasn't ended the turn, let the unit move
* if it has ended or if it's on terrain, load the main menu (options, end turn, save, etc.)
* if it's on a production building, load the build unit menu
* sounds a little complicated, but it shouldn't be so bad
* we haven't added units yet, so that part will just be placeholder stuff for now
